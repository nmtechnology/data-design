	<h1>User Case And Interaction</h1>

		<h5>As a DJ Terrence performs at music venues on a regular basis. He is a regular visitor user on Soundcloud, I want to be able to search specifically by music genre or tempo.
			As a DJ on Soundcloud I want to be able to build a following of fans under my profile so I want to pay for the Pro account to help me do that. I currently have a free account
			and I am not able to see play stats on my music I post on my feed.
